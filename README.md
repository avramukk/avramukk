# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 
I am an Engineer with a focus on Streaming. I am doing QA and DevOps stuff now.

Also, I am a little bit of a nerd and geeky about improving my environment, so check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/avramukk/dotfiles).

I am continuously learning and improving my skills and sharing them in my [lab](https://github.com/avramukk/lab) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/avramukk/projects/3)

You can find information and my CV on my website: https://avramukk.com
